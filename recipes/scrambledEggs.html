        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Scrambled eggs is a classic, quick, and easy breakfast dish that is both nourishing and versatile. This simple rendition uses a few staple ingredients: eggs, salt, pepper, and butter. Adding cheese is optional, but itâ€™s a delicious way to add an extra layer of flavor and texture. The key to perfect scrambled eggs is cooking on medium-low heat and constant stirring which results in soft curds of gentle, creamy eggs.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>Salt, to taste</li>
            <li>Pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of grated Cheddar cheese (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Whisk eggs, salt, and pepper in a bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat butter in a non-stick skillet over medium heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour in the egg mixture and let it sit without stirring for a few seconds until it starts to set around the edges.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir the eggs continuously with a spatula, pushing them from one side of the skillet to the other until large curds begin to form and the eggs are almost cooked, but still slightly runny.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove from heat and sprinkle with cheese, if using. The residual heat will continue to cook them slightly and melt the cheese. Serve hot.
            </li>
        </ol>
