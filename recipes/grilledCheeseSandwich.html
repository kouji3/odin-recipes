    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A grilled cheese sandwich is a timeless dish that is universally loved. It's simple, yet absolutely satisfying. The classic version involves sandwiching a slice of cheese between two pieces of bread, which is then toasted on a skillet until golden brown and the cheese melts to gooey perfection. The outside is crisp and buttery, while the inside is irresistibly cheesy. It's the ultimate comfort food that pairs perfectly with a bowl of tomato soup or a side of chips.
