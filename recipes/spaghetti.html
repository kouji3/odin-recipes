    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Spaghetti Aglio e Olio is a traditional Italian pasta dish from Naples. It's arguably one of the simplest and most satisfying pasta recipes out there. Aglio e Olio means 'garlic and oil' in Italian, and indeed, the dish involves little more than these along with pasta and a pinch of chili flakes. Despite its simplicity, it's incredibly delicious and deeply comforting. The pasta is cooked until al dente and then tossed in a flavor-packed mixture of saut√©ed garlic, olive oil, and red chili flakes. It's usually topped off with a sprinkling of fresh parsley and a generous dusting of Parmesan cheese, resulting in a flavor-packed meal that's quick and easy to prepare.
